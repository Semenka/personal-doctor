# Personal Doctor

Your AI health advisor powered by Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite. It collects wearable data from Oura Ring, scans medical reports from Google Drive, and generates a personalized daily health plan focused on sperm motility and energy optimization — delivered to your email every morning.

## Quick commands

- **"Run my health pipeline"** — triggers the full daily pipeline: Oura sync → Drive scan → AI advisor → email
- **"Get my health advice"** — generates and shows today's AI health plan
- **"Check my health status"** — shows the server health check (services, last run)
- **"Show my last advice"** — displays the most recent daily health plan
- **"Show health logs"** — displays recent pipeline execution logs
- **"Sync my Oura data"** — pulls today's sleep, activity, and readiness from Oura Ring
- **"Analyze my MRI/X-ray"** — analyzes a medical image for pathologies

## How it works

The Personal Doctor runs as a local server on your Mac Mini with a background scheduler:

| Time | Job |
|------|-----|
| 07:00 | Google Drive health folder scan (blood tests, genetic reports, health check-ups, prescriptions, MRI/X-ray) |
| 07:20 | Oura Ring data sync (sleep score, HRV, resting HR, steps, readiness) |
| 07:30 | AI Daily Advisor generates plan with Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite → saves locally → uploads to Drive → emails to you |

## Running the pipeline

To run the full pipeline on demand:

```bash
cd ~/personal-doctor
.venv/bin/python -m app.sync.run_pipeline
```

Or trigger specific steps:

```bash
# Oura data only
.venv/bin/python -m app.sync.cli --source oura

# AI advisor + email
.venv/bin/python -m app.sync.cli --source advisor --email

# AI advisor + email + Drive upload
.venv/bin/python -m app.sync.cli --source advisor --email --upload

# Analyze a medical image
.venv/bin/python -m app.sync.cli --source scan --path ~/Downloads/mri_knee.jpg

# Scan Google Drive for new reports
.venv/bin/python -m app.sync.cli --source gdrive
```

## Server endpoints

If the server is running (default on port 8000):

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Trigger pipeline now
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run

# Get last advice as JSON
curl http://localhost:8000/advice

# View recent logs
curl http://localhost:8000/logs
```

## Data sources

The advisor combines data from multiple sources:

1. **Oura Ring** — sleep hours, HRV, resting heart rate, steps, readiness score
2. **Google Drive** `me/health/` — auto-scans these typed subfolders (recursively):
   - `blood/` — blood test results
   - `sperm/` — sperm analysis
   - `genetic/` — genetic test results (MTHFR, COMT, VDR, etc.)
   - `health_check/` — annual medical check-ups
   - `prescription/` — prescriptions
   - `conclusion/` — doctor conclusions
   - Root files and MRI/X-ray images are also detected
3. **Image analysis** — Gemini Vision analyzes MRI, X-ray, CT scans for pathologies
